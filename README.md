## Learning Goals

- Recall our Three Pillars of Web Programming
- Describe the process of communicating with the server
- Define AJAX

## Introduction

We're two-thirds of the way through our exploration of using JavaScript with the
DOM. We know how to navigate and change the DOM and we know how to make and
recognize events. Along the way, we picked up necessary bits of JavaScript. Now
we're getting ready to pull it all together.

## Recall Our Three Pillars of Web Programming

Remember our pillars? By this point, they should feel familiar, but it's
worthwhile to refer back to them as we move along to keep our journey in
perspective. So, in that spirit, our three pillars of web programming are:

- Manipulating the DOM
- Creating events
- Communicating with the server

The last piece, how we send and retrieve information from the server, is what we
need to complete our "favoriting" app.

## Describe the Process of Communicating With the Server

In our Simple Liker app, “favoriting” is a click event on a heart icon that
updates the user’s DOM to show a full heart.

The click event kicks off a sequence of actions to notify the server that the
post has received a like. The server updates the post in the backend then passes
a message back to the browser indicating that the update was made successfully.
When that success message is received, we then update the DOM to reflect the
change.

> change in the backend.

The user doesn't see this entire process happening. Ideally, the process moves
quickly enough that the user barely even notices that it took place. All they
know is that the little heart icon is now reflecting their clicked appreciation.
To keep the user experience fast and smooth, we use something called the _AJAX
technique_.

## Define AJAX

_AJAX_ is short for "asynchronous JavaScript and XML," and it's the process used
to make requests to the server and update the DOM without reloading the web
page. There are a few different ways to implement this; a bit later in this
section we'll take a look at one of the most efficient ways: `fetch()`.

The name "asynchronous JavaScript and XML" arises from the fact that, in the
past, the data sent back to the browser from the server was encoded as XML. Now,
however, it's most often sent back in a format known as JSON ("Jay-Sawn").
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a `String` that JavaScript knows how to
turn into an `Object`. Using JavaScript, we can access the JSON returned by the
server and use it to update the DOM.

## Conclusion

The last skill we need to be effective JavaScript web programmers is
communication with the server. Once we've mastered this final step, we will be
able to listen for an event, persist the change to the backend, and manipulate
the DOM to reflect the updated information. With the AJAX technique, we'll learn
how to send and receive data quickly so that we keep our users' experience a
positive one.
